*The project was started to implement path following for UAVs using simple guidance laws in urban environments with occlusions.

*Some well defined urban scenarios were generated in MATLAB and visibility regions for UAVs at a particular height was generated 
 using simple geometry. 

*This was followed by implementing guidance laws to allow the UAVs to track targets on the road.
